## Run the program with various assignments to OMP_SCHEDULE.
## All of the below are run on the range (0,1) with 10 trapezoids.
## The array corresponds to the thread executing the corresponding element of 
## the for loop, note that the first element is always executed outside of the loop.

"static,1" : [ x 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ]
"static,2" : [ x 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 ]
"dynamic,1" : [ x 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 ]
"dynamic,2" : [ x 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 ]
"guided,1" : [ x 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 ]
"guided,2" : [ x 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 ]

## What is the default assignment of iterations on your system?

(personal system)
	After three runs my thread assignments looked like the following by default...
	[ 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 ]
	[ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ]
	[ 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 ]
	There doesn't seem to be any strict assignment, so that would indicate
	either dynamic or guided. General group sizes towards the end are smaller
	than they are at the beginning, so looks like guided is the default for
	my system.

	TODO

## How are guided schedules determined?

Each thread is initially assigned a group of chunk size data to work with.
Upon completion of that chunk, the thread is assigned a new but smaller
chunk to work on.
