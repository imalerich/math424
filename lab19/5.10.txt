## All tests performed on a sum of n = 100,000,000

Number of Threads : Execution Time
1 : 1.3754333
2 : 4.191148
3 : 5.421126
4 : 6.156786

Here we can see that for each process added, the execution time increases.
The most drastic increase is from 1 to 2 threads, after that each increase
is roughly another second or so.

## Does your implementation of OpenMP allow simultaneous executions of updates
## to different variables when the updates are protected by atomic directives.

No it does not. As the greatly increase in runtime 
with an increasing number of threads indicates.
