## What happens? Explain the difference.

1 thread vs 2 threads on omp_trap2a has an improvement of 1.9949
1 thread vs 2 threads on omp_trap2b has an improvement of 1947.0

Obviously omp_trap2b performs much better, that is, using the reduction
rather than a parallel for performs better. The key feature to note here
is the use of the reduction, 2a spawns two threads each who run through
half of the loop iterations, but as they do so they are constantly waiting
for each other in the critical section so that only one is writing at a time.
In the worst case, each thread alternates in this critical section resulting
in near single thread performance. This is vastly different than the reduction
which doesn't need the critical code, this is because the reduction will keep
local results which perform half of their corresponding global sum, these
are then added together at the end, guaranteeing only one stop that needs
a critical section (the final addition). This maximizes the work that each
thread can do independently of the others.
