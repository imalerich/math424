A ran my script (5.2.sh) which runs for thread count equal to
the number of trapezoids, for every n from 10 to 100.
I started at 10 to make sure the estimate (if done correctly)
should in theory be somewhat accurate.

If two threads try to write to the global sum at the same time,
issues occered. When running my script I found a number of such
instances of this occurring.

Actual result should be 0.33333

n = 10 gave 0.2566
(but then n = 11 did very well at 0.347)
n = 15 gave 0.2800
n = 51 gave 0.2839
n = 91 gave 0.2782

As you can see these are fairly spread out and seem to randnomly
occur. It depends on when scheduling happens to occur relative
to threads.

The more trapezoids I use, the less impactful a failed write back
will be.

Conversely, the more threads I use the more likely a failed
write back is to occur.
